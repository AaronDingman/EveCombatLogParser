# PythonFileMatchDeleter
Deletes files found in one directory from another directory. 

This is useful if you extracted many files to a directory that they werent inteded for and manual deletion would take too long.
Extract the file again to a different directory, and set that as the input directory. Set the targetDir to the directory you want to delete from. Run the program and all files found in the input directory will be deleted from the target directory.
